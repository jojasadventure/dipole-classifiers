You are an expert linguist tasked with generating example sentences for a specific semantic concept. Your goal is to produce a JSON list of diverse, high-quality sentences that clearly embody one pole of a semantic dimension. The sentences embody their pole in a natural way, not just by bluntly using it's name.

The semantic dimension is: "{dimension_name}"

Generate a list of {num_samples} unique sentences that are strong examples of the "{pole_name}" pole. The sentences should be varied in structure and content but all must clearly represent the concept of "{pole_name}".

IMPORTANT:
- Only provide sentences for the "{pole_name}" pole.
- Do NOT provide the contrasting pole.
- Your output must be ONLY a valid JSON list of strings. Do not add any commentary or markdown formatting.

Example output format for a request of 3 samples:
[
  "Example sentence one.",
  "Another example sentence.",
  "A final, third example sentence."
]

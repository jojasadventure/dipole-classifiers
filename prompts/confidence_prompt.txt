# Custom prompt for the "Confidence: Tentative vs. Confident" dimension.
# V1: The original "happy accident" prompt with high consistency.

Generate exactly {num_pairs} unique pairs of sentences. Each pair should consist of:
1. A sentence representing the '{pole_a}' pole of the '{dimension_name}' dimension.
2. A sentence representing the '{pole_b}' pole of the '{dimension_name}' dimension.

Both sentences in a pair should be about the same core topic or situation, differing primarily along the '{dimension_name}' dimension ({pole_a} vs. {pole_b}). The topics should cover a range of professional and personal situations. Keep sentences relatively concise (approx. 10-30 words).

The Tentative sentence should express uncertainty, possibility, or use hedging language. The Confident sentence should express certainty, directness, and conviction, often stating something as a fact.

Format the output strictly as a JSON list of objects. Each object in the list must have exactly two keys: "{pole_a_key}" and "{pole_b_key}".

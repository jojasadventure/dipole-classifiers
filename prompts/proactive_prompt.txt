# Custom prompt for the "Agency: Reactive vs. Proactive" dimension.
# This prompt uses tailored examples to get higher quality pairs.

Generate exactly {num_pairs} unique pairs of sentences. Each pair should consist of:
1. A sentence representing the '{pole_a}' pole of the '{dimension_name}' dimension.
2. A sentence representing the '{pole_b}' pole of the '{dimension_name}' dimension.

Both sentences in a pair should be about the same core topic or situation, differing primarily along the '{dimension_name}' dimension ({pole_a} vs. {pole_b}). The topics should cover a range of professional and personal situations. Keep sentences relatively concise (approx. 10-30 words).

The Reactive sentence should describe an action taken in response to a past or current event. The Proactive sentence should describe an action taken to prepare for or influence a future event.

Format the output strictly as a JSON list of objects. Each object in the list must have exactly two keys: "{pole_a_key}" and "{pole_b_key}".

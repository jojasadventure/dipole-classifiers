# V2: Correcting the ambiguous "Direct" with "Concrete"
# Custom prompt for the "Immediacy: Concrete vs. Abstract" dimension.

Generate exactly {num_pairs} unique pairs of sentences. Each pair should consist of:
1. A sentence representing the '{pole_a}' pole of the '{dimension_name}' dimension.
2. A sentence representing the '{pole_b}' pole of the '{dimension_name}' dimension.

Both sentences in a pair should be about the same core topic or situation, differing primarily along the '{dimension_name}' dimension ({pole_a} vs. {pole_b}).

The Concrete sentence should use sensory language to describe a specific, tangible action or object. The Abstract sentence should describe the same situation using high-level concepts or general principles.

Format the output strictly as a JSON list of objects. Each object in the list must have exactly two keys: "{pole_a_key}" and "{pole_b_key}".

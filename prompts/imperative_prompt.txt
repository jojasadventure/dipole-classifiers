Generate exactly {{num_pairs}} unique pairs of sentences. Each pair should consist of:
1. A sentence representing the 'Statement' pole of the 'Imperative' dimension.
2. A sentence representing the 'Command/Request' pole of the 'Imperative' dimension.

Both sentences must be about the same core topic. The 'Statement' should be a simple declaration of fact or observation. The 'Command/Request' should explicitly or implicitly ask the listener to do something.

Format the output strictly as a JSON list of objects. Each object must have exactly two keys: "statement" and "command/request".

--- Examples of Good Contrastive Pairs ---

Key Principles:
1. **Minimal semantic drift**: The topic must be identical.
2. **Precision in opposition**: One is an observation, the other is an instruction.
3. **Content consistency**: Don't add new information in one of the pairs.

1. Topic: Project Report
- statement: "The Q3 performance report is now available."
  command/request: "Please review the Q3 performance report."

2. Topic: Software Update
- statement: "The new software update has been successfully installed."
  command/request: "Reboot your system to apply the new software update."

3. Topic: Dinner
- statement: "The soup seems to be missing something."
  command/request: "Could you please pass the salt?"

4. Topic: Schedule
- statement: "The meeting is scheduled for 3 PM."
  command/request: "Join the meeting at 3 PM sharp."
